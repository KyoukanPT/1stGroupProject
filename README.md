# Free Jerry
We're doing a game project in 10 nights on Academia de Codigo that will take 14 weeks to finish.	Game about jerry for A/C

Our game is about a rat that wants to "escape" Academia de Codigo but has to fight certain enemies to be able to actually leave.	

This project is being made by 4 people: Rúben Lima, Fábio Cardoso, Tiago Silva and Nuno Rodrigues.
